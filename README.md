# Transformer-Based Text Classifier

This project implements a Transformer-based deep learning model using PyTorch for text classification. It covers a complete pipeline from preprocessing raw text using NLP techniques to designing, training, and evaluating a custom Transformer architecture built from scratch.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Perform tokenization, stopword removal, and text cleaning.
- Train Word2Vec embeddings for input sequences.
- Design and implement a Transformer architecture using PyTorch.
- Train the model on custom text classification data.
- Evaluate model performance and visualize training dynamics.
